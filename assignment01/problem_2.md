# Two’s complement

Why use two’s complement to represent negative numbers?

## Answer

Number can be represented using either magnitude or complement representation:

- Magnitude unsigned rep. can only represent positive number whereas magnitude signed representaion leads to two representations for zero so we can't use that either.
- 1's complement may have been a good choice but it leads to the above mentioned multiple representation of zeros so we can't use that either.
- Only using 2's complement do we get different representation of a number 'x' and '-x'.

Moreover, as all computers as understand mathematics of 1's and 0's only, so to use the same logic circuits (the ALU) even negative numbers are expressed as 0's and 1's.
